# Ramdasauce

Adds a few utilities based on the delicious [Ramda](http://ramdajs.com/) library.

[![npm module](https://badge.fury.io/js/ramdasauce.svg)](https://www.npmjs.org/package/ramdasauce)


# Installing

`npm i ramdasauce --save`

* Depends on `ramda 0.24.+`.
* Targets ES5.
* Built with ES6.

# Usage

Here's the quick list of functions and a simple example.

```js
import RS from 'ramdasauce'

// --- Conversions ---
RS.toDate(1e12)             // a Number to a date Object
RS.toNumber('5')            // a String to a Number

// --- Object Shenanigans ---
const x = {a: 1, b: 2, c: {x: [5, 6]}}
RS.mapKeys(R.toUpper, x)    // transforms the keys of an object by the function
RS.dotPath('c.x.0', x)      // fetches a value from a nested object by a string path

// --- Generating Things ---
RS.rangeStep(2, 2, 10)      // generates a range of numbers with a step

// --- Finding Things ---
RS.findByProp('id', 'a', [{id: 'a', id: 'b'}])      // finds an object by propEq
RS.findIndexByProp('id', 'a', [{id: 'a', id: 'b'}]) // finds the index of an object by propEq

// --- Predicates ---
RS.isUndefined(qwerty)      // check if something is undefined
RS.isNotNil(null)           // check if something is not null or undefined
RS.isNilOrEmpty(null)       // checks if something is null, undefined or R.isEmpty
RS.isWithin(1, 2, 2)        // is the 3rd parameter within the range of 1st through 2nd?
RS.isNotWithin(1, 2, 100)   // is the 3rd parameter not within the range of 1st through 2nd?
RS.eqLength([1,2,3], 'abc') // tests 2 things to see if their length properties are the same
```

# Prior Art

Most of these functions were lifted from stuff I wrote in real projects.

(*leans in and whispers*)

I did look at these tho:

* https://github.com/Cottin/ramda-extras
* https://github.com/mediasuitenz/ramda-extended
* https://github.com/ramda/ramda/wiki/Cookbook
* https://github.com/seancannon/prettycats


# Philosophy

These helper functions target that sweet spot between:

> Not right for `ramda` core.

and

> Would never be used outside your app.

Functions being added here *must* be used in an app.  Preferable more than once.

I hope this library won't turn into something like this:

```js
RS.portmanteau('functor', 'wrecked')
RS.yearsForAnimalInAsianCalendars('monkey')
```
